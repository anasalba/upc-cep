/**
 * Counts objects in a sliding window.
 * <p>
 * An objects counter is split into buckets, with each bucket representing an equal fraction of time
 * of the overall window length. An objects total count is the sum of its buckets.
 * <p>
 * Counter increments are added to the head bucket, whilst a separate "reaper" thread advances the
 * window by shifting the head bucket and wiping the tail bucket every (windowLenSec / numBuckets)
 * seconds. Therefore as an objects frequency decreases, its total count also decreases over time.
 * Stale objects (those with a total count of zero) are removed from the list to free up memory.
 * <p>
 * Increasing the number of buckets increases the granularity of the counters (i.e. a higher number
 * of buckets causes the "reaper" thread to run more frequently, which in turn will decrement an
 * objects total count faster as its frequency decreases).
 * <p>
 * @param <T> The type of objects to count
